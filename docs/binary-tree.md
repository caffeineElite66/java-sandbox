# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree where each node has no more than 2 children.

Max number of nodes a level i can have is `maxNodes = Math.pow(2, i)`

The operational time complexity of a binary tree is proportional to the height of the tree. It is important to keep the height of the tree low.


A complete binary tree is:
1. exception the last level, all other nodes are filled.
2. should be filled as left as possible.

## Balance tree
### A balance binary tree is when the height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than 1.

A balanced binary tree is:
1. weight-balance tree
  * number of nodes in left vs right subtree is diff <= 1
2. height-balance tree
  * height of nodes in left vs right subtree is diff <= 1

Height of an empty tree = -1

Height of an tree with 1 node = 0

#### Check for height balance tree.
```
boolean isHeightBalanced(BTreeNode root) {
  return (maxLeafHeight(root) - minLeafHight(root)) <= 1;
}
```


 ## Store Binary Tree in Memory
 1. using a node class with pointers. (most common way)
 2. arrays. usually use for a perfect binary tree. `left-child-index = 2i+1` and `right-child-index = 2i+2` Need to be a complete binary tree.
